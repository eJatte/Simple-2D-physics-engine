# Simple-2D-physics-engine
Simple impulse based 2D physics engine using SAT collision detection.

For any potential employers. This project is not what i would consider a finished product, more of a prototype or proof of concept. However, I chose to make it public because a lot of work went into it and it works quite well if you ignore the *smelly* code. I simply have not found the time to revisit and refactor the project.

*This project was originally made during august 2018. Uploaded to Github 2019-02-23.*
